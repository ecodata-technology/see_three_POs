The caterpillars defoliate trees, stripping them clean of the ability to photosynthesize and devastating acres of forest and residential green-space.\n\nEcodata scraped climate data and merged it with iNaturalist field surveys, then modeled pest densities in time and space using cumulative degree days. \n\nWith these fitted general additive models, we can then forecast where and when both caterpillars and adults will appear by feeding in future climate data.

The payoff is easy access for stakeholders to state-of-the-art, demanding models built on up-to-date data. We take inspiration from the tech industry's approach to MLOps.\n\nOur data and scripts are stored on an Amazon Web Service EC2 instance, which scales on-the-fly to meet computing needs. The Ubuntu virtual machine also hosts the Shiny server used to share the results on the web, and Nginx and Certbot for accessibility and security.\n\nFrom there we can embed our apps in convenient web reports like this one, built with Hugo, maintained on GitHub, and deployed on Netlify.","tags":["Problem"],"title":"Leveraging industry standards","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c7c62efe8685cb3ce27ae31c3c88f86e","permalink":"https://ecodata-shiny-demo.netlify.app/project/three/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/three/","section":"project","summary":"\nSpotted lanternfly is a recent threat, arriving in North America in 2014. These pests feed on a wide range of crops including grapes, apples, hops, walnuts, and hardwood trees. Early detection of is a vital step in containing its spread.\n\nEcodata is exploring how Bayesian GAMs can provide more better forecasts of pests, both in Spotted lanternfly and Spongy moth. We've found that Bayesian GAMs can predict both caterpillar and adult emergence in Spongy moth, supporting more sophisticated control strategies based on life stage.\n\nThough data quality and quantity are still low for lanternfly, a similar approach will be valuable for managing this new invasive species. As we progress from research and development, the models will be put into production as another web app.","tags":["Solution"],"title":"What we're doing next","type":"project"}]
